 * Abstract Factory patterns works around a super-factory which creates other factories. This
factory is also called as Factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under creational
pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects,
without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the
Factory pattern.

 * We're going to create a Shape and Color interfaces and concrete classes implementing these
interfaces. We creates an abstract factory class AbstractFactory as next step. Factory
classesShapeFactory and ColorFactory are defined where each factory extends AbstractFactory.
A factory creator/generator class FactoryProducer is created.

AbstractFactoryPatternDemo, our demo class uses FactoryProducer to get a AbstractFactory object. 
It will pass information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE for Shape) to AbstractFactory to get the type of object it needs. It also passes information (RED / GREEN /
BLUE for Color) to AbstractFactory to get the type of object it needs.
